week 9 status update for REDA

still working on creating a visualization for my word embeddings using T-SNE, a technique for high dimension visualization.

after visualization I will move onto seq2seq research learning to embed sentences. However, this technique has not been devloped or researched by the prominent word2vec reserachers.
This is my block. 

For the coming week the visuazliation will be prioritized and pushed to git.
