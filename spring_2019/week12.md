week 12 status updates


This week's progress was mainly in the form of creating more visualizations. 
Instead of using my down embeddings(results) I wanted to try using google's embeddings inorder to test if my visualization parameters are incorrect or if my embeddings are faulty.

My main block is the run time of my program while it's creating each visualization (5mins), thus only able to test a couple a day.
