week 08 status update

fixed bug in reverse dictionary, had a key error.
skip-gram fully implemented.

Reda recognized frequent words such as I,you,help,assist are associated with words in close proximity.
Loss / accuracy is no where near values obtained by google (Mikolov).

For the chatbot portion, I indent to store the embedding matrix for sentecnes and words into a database and access/change it there instead locally.

Furthermore there needs to be research done on how to change embedding matrix based on a small amount of data without overfitting.
