accidentally deletely all local repo code :(

Had large file (1GB) in my repo and tried to push without my knowledge that thislarge file was in my repo.
I canceled my push and moved this large file outside my repo. 
However, even after recommiting my new repo the git push was trying to push something large (1GB+).
After looking though the internet I used a solution that made my local repo the same as the git one.


Thus I have to rewrite my code from the past couple days.
