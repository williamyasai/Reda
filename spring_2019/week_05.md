Research into cbow and skipgram. 
Implementation details and learning how to create the model.

By the end of week 5 I should have cbow done without tests
By the end of week 7 tests should be done.


Edit:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/tutorials/embedding/word2vec.py
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py
are two major repos I am using to learn

major blocks are 
1) understanding tensorflow and embeddings
2) how to adjust weights and biases in my second layer of the network to accomodate for a small data size.
